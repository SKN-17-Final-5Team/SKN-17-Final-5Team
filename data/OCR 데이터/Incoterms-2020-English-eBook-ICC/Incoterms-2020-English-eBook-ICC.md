By John W.H. Denton, AO, ICC Secretary General

The growth of the global economy has given most businesses greater access than ever before to markets all over the world. Goods are sold today in more countries, in larger quantities, in greater variety, and at a faster pace as a result. But as both the volume and complexity of global trade increase, so do possibilities for misunderstandings and costly disputes when sale contracts are not adequately drafted.

The ICC Incoterms® rules on the use of domestic and international trade terms address this risk by facilitating the conduct of global trade. Reference to an Incoterms® 2020 rule in a contract for the sale of goods clearly defines the parties' respective obligations regarding topics such as risk, cost and arrangement of transport and customs clearance, thereby reducing the potential for legal complications.

Since ICC first codified a set of standard trading terms as the Incoterms® rules in 1936, this globally accepted contractual standard has been updated periodically to reflect the evolution of international trade. The Incoterms® 2020 rules take account of the increased attention to security in the movement of goods, the need for flexibility in insurance coverage depending on the nature of goods and transport, and the call by banks for an on-board bill of lading in certain financed sales under the FCA rule.

*Incoterms® 2020* also offers a simpler and clearer presentation of all the rules, featuring revised language, an expanded introduction and explanatory notes, and articles reordered to better reflect the logic of a sale transaction. *Incoterms® 2020* is also the first version of ICC's Incoterms® rules to include a 'horizontal' presentation, grouping all like articles together and allowing users to clearly see differences in treatment of particular issues across the 11 Incoterms® rules.

ICC's deep expertise in commercial law—drawn from a global membership representing all trade sectors and companies of all sizes—ensures that *Incoterms® 2020* responds to business needs everywhere.

ICC would like to express its gratitude to the members of the drafting group from the ICC Commission on Commercial Law and Practice for their contributions to *Incoterms® 2020*. The working group comprised David Lowe (Co-Chair, UK), Christoph Martin Radtke (Co-Chair, France), Charles Debattista(Special Advisor, UK), Ercüment Erdem (Turkey), Virginie Jan (Jian Baozhu (China)), Burghard Piltz (Germany), Frank Reynolds (US), and Bob Ronai (Australia). We also thank Asko Räty (Finland) for his assistance with the images depicting the 11 rules.

Our appreciation is also due to Emily O'Connor (Director, Multilateral Rules for Trade and Investment, ICC) and Florence Binta Diao-Gueye (Commission on Commercial Law and Practice, ICC).# Contents

   - to set out the important fundamentals of the Incoterms® rules: the basic roles and responsibilities of seller and buyer, delivery, risk, and the relationship between the Incoterms® rules and the contracts surrounding a typical contract of sale for export/import and also, where appropriate, for domestic sales;
   - to explain how best to choose the right Incoterms® rule for the particular sale contract; and
   - to set out the central changes between *Incoterms® 2010* and *Incoterms® 2020*.

3. This Introduction gives guidance on the use of, and about the fundamental principles behind, the Incoterms® 2020 rules.

### I. WHAT THE INCOTERMS® RULES DO

1. The Incoterms® rules explain a set of eleven of the most commonly-used three-letter trade terms, e.g. CIF, DAP, etc., reflecting business-to-business practice in contracts for the sale and purchase of goods.
2. The Incoterms® rules describe:
   - *Obligations*: Who does what as between seller and buyer, e.g. who organises carriage or insurance of the goods or who obtains shipping documents and export or import licences;
   - *Risk*: Where and when the seller "delivers" the goods, in other words where risk transfers from seller to buyer; and
   - *Costs*: Which party is responsible for which costs, for example transport, packaging, loading or unloading costs, and checking or security-related costs.

The Incoterms® rules cover these areas in a set of ten articles, numbered A1/B1 etc., the A articles representing the seller's obligations and the B articles representing the buyer's obligations. See paragraph 53 below.

### II. WHAT THE INCOTERMS® RULES DO NOT DO

1. The Incoterms® rules are NOT in themselves—and are therefore no substitute for—a contract of sale. They are devised to reflect trade practice for no particular type of goods—and for any. They can be used as much for the trading of a bulk cargo of iron ore as for five containers of electronic equipment or ten pallets of airfreighted fresh flowers.
2. The Incoterms® rules do NOT deal with the following matters:
   - whether there is a contract of sale at all;
   - the specifications of the goods sold;
   - the time, place, method or currency of payment of the price;- the remedies which can be sought for breach of the contract of sale;
- most consequences of delay and other breaches in the performance of contractual obligations;
- the effect of sanctions;
- the imposition of tariffs;
- export or import prohibitions;
- force majeure or hardship;
- intellectual property rights; or
- the method, venue, or law of dispute resolution in case of such breach.

Perhaps most importantly, it must be stressed that the Incoterms® rules do NOT deal with the transfer of property/title/ownership of the goods sold.

**8.** These are matters for which the parties need to make specific provision in their contract of sale. Failure to do so is likely to cause problems later if disputes arise about performance and breach. In essence, the Incoterms® 2020 rules are *not* themselves a contract of sale: they only become *part* of that contract when they are incorporated into a contract which already exists. Neither do the Incoterms® rules provide the law applicable to the contract. There may be legal regimes which apply to the contract, whether international, like the Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG); or domestic mandatory law relating, for example, to health and safety or the environment.

### III. HOW BEST TO INCORPORATE THE INCOTERMS® RULES

**9.** If parties want the Incoterms® 2020 rules to apply to their contract, the safest way to ensure this is to make that intention clear in their contract, through words such as

**“[the chosen Incoterms® rule] [named port, place or point] Incoterms® 2020”.**

**10.** Thus, for example, CIF Shanghai Incoterms® 2020, or DAP No 123, ABC Street, Importland Incoterms® 2020.

**11.** Leaving the year out could cause problems that may be difficult to resolve. The parties, a judge or an arbitrator need to be able to determine which version of the Incoterms® rules applies to the contract.

**12.** The place named next to the chosen Incoterms® rule is even more important:

- in all Incoterms® rules except the C rules, the named place indicates where the goods are “delivered”, i.e. where risk transfers from seller to buyer;
- in the D rules, the named place is the place of delivery and also the place of destination and the seller must organise carriage to that point;
- in the C rules, the named place indicates the destination to which the seller must organise and pay for the carriage of the goods, which is not, however, the place or port of delivery.

**13.** Thus, an FOB sale raising doubt about the port of shipment leaves both parties uncertain as to where the buyer must present the ship to the seller for the shipment and the transport of the goods—and as to where the seller must deliver the goods on board so as to transfer risk in the goods from seller to buyer. Again, a CPT contract with an unclear named destination will leave both parties in doubt as to the point to which the seller must contract and pay for the transport of the goods.

**14.** It is best to avoid these types of issues by being as geographically specific as possible in naming the port, place or point, as the case may be, in the chosen Incoterms® rule.

**15.** When incorporating a particular Incoterms® 2020 rule into a sale contract, it is not necessary to use the trademark symbol. For further guidance on trademark and copyright, please refer to <https://iccwbo.org/incoterms-copyright/>.

### IV. DELIVERY, RISK AND COSTS IN THE INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES

**16.** A named place or port attached to the three letters, e.g. CIP Las Vegas or CIF Los Angeles, then, is critical in the workings of the Incoterms® 2020 rules. Depending on which Incoterms® 2020 rule is chosen, that place will identify either the place or port at which the goods are considered to have been “delivered” by the seller to the buyer, the place of “delivery”, or the place or port to which the seller must organise the carriage of the goods, i.e. their destination; or, in the case of the D rules, both.17. In all Incoterms® 2020 rules, A2 will define the place or port of “delivery”—and that place or port is closest to the seller in EXW and FCA (seller’s premises) and closest to the buyer in DAP, DPU and DDP.

18. The place or port of delivery identified by A2 is critical both for risk and for costs.

19. The place or port of delivery under A2 marks the place at which risk transfers from seller to buyer under A3. It is at that place or port that the seller performs its obligation to provide the goods under the contract as reflected in A1 such that the buyer cannot recover against the seller for the loss of or damage to the goods occurring after that point has passed.

20. The place or port of delivery under A2 also marks the central point under A9 which allocates costs to seller and buyer. In broad terms, A9 allocates costs before the point of delivery to the seller and costs after that point to the buyer.

## Delivery points

### Extremes and in-betweens: the four traditional Incoterms® rules groups

21. Versions of the Incoterms® rules before 2010 traditionally grouped the rules into four, namely E, F, C and D, with E and D lying at extreme poles from each other in terms of the point of delivery and the F and C rules lying in between. While the Incoterms® rules have, since 2010, been grouped according to the means of transport used, the old groupings are still helpful in understanding the point of delivery. Thus, the delivery point in EXW is an agreed point for collection of the goods by the buyer, whatever the destination to which the buyer will take them. At the other extreme in DAP, DPU and DDP, the delivery point is the same as the destination point to which the seller or its carrier will carry the goods. In the first, EXW, risk transfers before the transport cycle even starts; in the second, the D rules, risk transfers very late in that cycle. Again, in the first, EXW and, for that matter, FCA (seller’s premises), the seller performs its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not they actually arrive at their destination. In the second, the seller performs its obligation to deliver the goods only if they actually arrive at their destination.

22. The two rules at the extreme ends of the Incoterms® rules are EXW and DDP. However, traders should consider alternative rules to these two for their international contracts. Thus, with EXW the seller has to merely put the goods at the buyer’s disposal. This may cause problems for the seller and the buyer, respectively, with loading and export clearance. The seller would be better advised to sell under the FCA rule. Likewise, with DDP, the seller owes some obligations to the buyer which can only be performed within the buyer’s country, for example obtaining import clearance. It may be physically or legally difficult for the seller to carry out those obligations within the buyer’s country and a seller would therefore be better advised to consider selling goods in such circumstances under the DAP or DPU rules.

23. Between the two extremes of E and D rules, there lie the three F rules (FCA, FAS and FOB), and the four C rules (CPT, CIP, CFR and CIF).

24. With all seven F and C rules, the place of delivery is on the seller’s side of the anticipated carriage: consequently sales using these Incoterms® rules are often called “shipment” sales. Delivery occurs, for example,

1. when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the port of loading in CFR, CIF and FOB; or
2. by handing the goods over to the carrier in CPT and CIP; or
3. by loading them on the means of transport provided by the buyer or placing them at the disposal of the buyer’s carrier in FCA.

In the F and C groups, risk transfers at the seller’s end of the main carriage such that the seller will have performed its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods actually arrive at their destination. This feature, of being shipment sales with delivery happening at the seller’s end early in the transit cycle, is common to the F and the C rules, whether they are the maritime Incoterms® rules or the Incoterms® rules intended for any mode[s] of transport.

25. The F and the C rules do, however, differ as to whether it is the seller or buyer who contracts for or arranges the carriage of the goods beyond the place or port of delivery. In the F rules, it is the buyer who makes such arrangements, unless the parties agree otherwise. In the C rules, this obligation falls to the seller.

26. Given that a seller on any of the C rules contracts for or arranges the carriage of the goods beyond delivery, the parties need to know what the destination is to which it must arrange carriage—and that is the place attached to the name of the Incoterms® rule, e.g. “CIF the port of Dalian” or “CIP the inland city ofShenyang". Whatever that named destination is, that place is not and never becomes the place of delivery. Risk will have transferred on shipment or on handing over the goods at the place of delivery, but the contract of carriage must have been made by the seller for the named destination. Delivery and destination, then, in the C rules, are necessarily not the same place.

#### V. INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES AND THE CARRIER

27. In the F and the C rules, placing the goods, for example, on board the vessel or handing them over to, or placing them at the disposal of, the carrier marks the point at which the goods are "delivered" by the seller to the buyer. Therefore this is the point at which risk transfers from the seller to the buyer.

28. Given those two important consequences, it becomes essential to identify who the carrier is where there is more than one carrier, each carrying out a separate leg of transport, for instance by road, rail, air or sea. Of course, where the seller has taken the far more prudent course of making one contract of carriage with one carrier taking responsibility for the entire carriage chain, in a so-called "through" contract of carriage, the problem does not arise. However, where there is no such "through" carriage contract, the goods could be handed over (where the CIP or CPT rules are used) to a road-haulier or rail company for onward transmission to a sea carrier. The same situation may arise with exclusively maritime transport where, for example, the goods are first handed over to a river or feeder short-sea carrier for onward transmission to an ocean carrier.

29. In these situations, when does the seller "deliver" the goods to the buyer: when it hands the goods over to the first, second or third carrier?

30. Before we answer that question, a preliminary point. While in most cases the carrier will be an independent third party engaged under a contract of carriage by either the seller or the buyer (depending on whether the parties have chosen a C Incoterms® rule or an F Incoterms® rule), there are situations where no such independent third party is engaged at all because the seller or the buyer itself will carry the goods sold. This is more likely to happen in the D rules (DAP, DPU and DDP), where the seller may use its own means of transport to carry the goods to the buyer at the delivery destination. Provision has therefore been made in the Incoterms® 2020 rules for a seller under the D rules either to *contract for carriage* or to *arrange for carriage*, that is to say through its own means of transport: see A4.

31. The question asked at paragraph 29 above is not simply a "carriage" question: it is an important "sale" question. The question is not which carrier can a seller or buyer of goods damaged in transit sue under the contract of carriage. The "sale" question is: where there is more than one carrier involved in the carriage of the goods from seller to buyer, at which point in the carriage string does the handing over of the goods mark the point of delivery and the transfer of risk *as between seller and buyer*?

32. There needs to be a simple answer to this question because the relationships between the multiple carriers used, and between the seller and/or the buyer with those several carriers, will be complex, depending as they do on the terms of a number of separate contracts of carriage. Thus, for example, in any such chain of contracts of carriage, one carrier, such as a carrier actually performing a leg of the transit by road, may well act as the seller's agent in concluding a contract of carriage with a carrier by sea.

33. The Incoterms® 2020 rules give a clear answer to this question where the parties contract on FCA. In FCA, the relevant carrier is the carrier nominated by the buyer to whom the seller hands over the goods at the place or point agreed in the contract of sale. Thus even if a seller engages a road haulier to take the goods to the agreed delivery point, risk would transfer not at the place and time where the seller hands the goods over to the haulier engaged by the seller, but at the place and time where the goods are placed at the disposal of the carrier engaged by the buyer. This is why the naming of the place or point of delivery as precisely as possible is so important in FCA sales. The same situation can arise in FOB if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the vessel engaged by the buyer. A similar answer is provided by Incoterms® 2020: delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the buyer's carrier.

34. With the C rules, the position is more complex and may well attract different solutions under different legal systems. In CPT and CIP, the relevant carrier is likely to be regarded, at any rate in some jurisdictions, as the first carrier to whom the seller hands over the goods under A2 (unless the parties have agreed on the point of delivery). The buyer knows nothing of the contractual arrangements made between the seller and the first or subsequent carriers, or indeed between that first carrier and subsequent carriers. What the buyer does know, however, is that the goods are "in transit" to him or her—and that "transit" starts as far as the buyer knows, when the goods are put by the seller into the hands of the first carrier. The consequence isthat risk transfers from seller to buyer at that early stage of “delivery” to the first carrier. The same situation can arise in CFR and CIF if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the agreed port of shipment, if any. A similar answer might be suggested in some legal systems: delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the agreed port of shipment, if any.

35. Such a conclusion, if adopted, may seem harsh on the buyer. Risk would transfer from seller to buyer in CPT and CIP sales when the goods are handed over to the first carrier. The buyer does not know at that stage whether or not that first carrier is responsible for loss of or damage to the goods under the relevant carriage contract. The buyer is not a party to that contract, has no control over it and will not know its terms. Yet, despite this, the buyer would end up bearing the risk in the goods from the very earliest moment of handing over, possibly without recovery against that first carrier.

36. While the buyer would end up bearing the risk of loss of or damage to the goods at an early stage of the transport chain, it would, on this view however, have a remedy against the seller. A2/A3 do not operate in a vacuum: under A4, the seller must contract for the carriage of the goods “from the agreed point of delivery, if any, at the place of delivery to the named place of destination or, if agreed, any point at that place.” Even if risk has transferred to the buyer at the time the goods were handed over to the first carrier under A2/A3, if that first carrier does not undertake responsibility under its contract of carriage for the through carriage of the goods to the named destination, the seller, on this view, would remain liable to the buyer under A4. In essence, the seller should make a contract of carriage to the destination named under the contract of sale.

## VI. RULES FOR THE CONTRACT OF SALE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CONTRACTS

37. This discussion of the role of the carrier in the delivery of the goods as between the seller and the buyer in the C and F Incoterms® rules raises the question: what role do the Incoterms® rules play in the contract of carriage, or, indeed, in any of the other contracts typically surrounding an export contract, for example an insurance contract or a letter of credit?

38. The short answer is that the Incoterms® rules do not form part of those other contracts: where incorporated, the Incoterms® rules apply to and govern *only* certain aspects of the contract of sale.

39. This is not the same as saying, however, that the Incoterms® rules have no *impact* on those other contracts. Goods are exported and imported through a network of contracts that, in an ideal world, should match the one with the other. Thus, the sale contract, for example, will require the tender of a transport document issued by the carrier to the seller/shipper under a contract of carriage and against which the seller/shipper/beneficiary might wish to be paid under a letter of credit. Where the three contracts match, things go well; where they do not, problems rapidly arise.

40. What the Incoterms® rules say, for example, about carriage or transport documents (in A4/B4 and A6/B6), or what they say about insurance cover (A5/B5), does not *bind* the carrier or the insurer or any of the banks involved. Thus, a carrier is only bound to issue a transport document as required by the contract of carriage it makes with the other party to *that* contract: it is not bound to issue a transport document complying with the Incoterms® rules. Likewise, an insurer is bound to issue a policy to the level and in the terms agreed with the party purchasing the insurance, not a policy which complies with the Incoterms® rules. Finally, a bank will look only at the documentary requirements in the letter of credit, if any, not at the requirements of the sales contract.

41. However, it is very much in the interests of all the parties to the different contracts in the network to ensure that the carriage or insurance terms they have agreed with the carrier or insurer, or the terms of a letter of credit, comply with what the sale contract says about ancillary contracts that need to be made or documents that need to be obtained and tendered. *That* task does not fall on the carrier, the insurer or the bank, none of whom are party to the contract of sale and none of whom are, therefore, party to or bound by the Incoterms® 2020 rules. It *is*, however, in the seller's and buyer's interest to try to ensure that the different parts of the network of contracts match—and the starting point is the sale contract—and therefore, where they apply, the Incoterms® 2020 rules.

## VII. THE ELEVEN INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES—“SEA AND INLAND WATERWAY” AND “ANY MODE(S) OF TRANSPORT”: GETTING IT RIGHT

42. The main distinction introduced in the Incoterms® 2010 rules, that between **Rules for any Mode or Modes of Transport** (comprising EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, the newly named DPU—the old DAT—andDDP), and **Rules for Sea and Inland Waterway Transport**, (comprising FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF) has been retained.

43. The four so-called “maritime” Incoterms® rules are intended for use where the seller places the goods on board (or in FAS alongside) a vessel at a sea or river port. It is at this point that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer. When these rules are used, the risk of loss of or damage to those goods is on the buyer’s shoulders from that port.

44. The seven Incoterms® rules for any mode or modes of transport (so-called “multi-modal”), on the other hand, are intended for use where

1. the point at which the seller hands the goods over to, or places them at the disposal of, a carrier, or
2. the point at which the carrier hands the goods over to the buyer, or the point at which they are placed at the disposal of the buyer, or
3. both points (a) and (b)

are not on board (or in FAS alongside) a vessel.

45. Where delivery happens and risk transfers in each of these seven Incoterms® rules will depend on which particular rule is used. For example, in CPT, delivery happens at the seller’s end when the goods are handed over to the carrier contracted by the seller. In DAP, on the other hand, delivery happens when the goods are placed at the buyer’s disposal at the named place or point of destination.

46. The order in which the Incoterms® 2010 rules were presented has, as we have said, been largely retained in *Incoterms® 2020* and it is important to underline the distinction between the two families of Incoterms® rules so that the right rule is used for the contract of sale depending on the means of transport used.

47. One of the most frequent problems in the use of the Incoterms® rules is the choice of the wrong rule for the particular type of contract.

48. Thus, for example, an FOB inland point (for example an airport or a warehouse) sale contract makes little sense: what type of contract of carriage must the buyer make? Does the buyer owe the seller an obligation to make a contract of carriage under which the carrier is bound to take over the goods at the named inland point or at the nearest port to that point?

49. Again, a CIF named sea port sale contract where the buyer expects the goods to be brought to an inland point in the buyer’s country makes little sense. Must the seller procure a contract of carriage and insurance cover to the eventual inland destination intended by the parties or to the seaport named in the sale contract?

50. Gaps, overlaps and unnecessary costs are likely to arise—and all this because the wrong Incoterms® rule has been chosen for the particular contract. What makes the mismatch “wrong” is that insufficient regard has been given to the two most important features of the Incoterms® rules, features which are mirrors of each other, namely the port, place or point of delivery and the transfer of risks.

51. The reason for the frequent misuse of the wrong Incoterms® rule is that Incoterms® rules are frequently regarded exclusively as price indicators: this or that is the EXW, FOB, or DAP price. The initials used in the Incoterms® rules are doubtless handy abbreviations for the formula used in the calculation of the price. Incoterms® rules are not, however, exclusively, or even primarily, price indicators. They are a list of general obligations that sellers and buyers owe each other under well-recognised forms of sale contract—and one of their main tasks is to indicate the port, place or point of delivery where the risk is transferred.

### VIII. ORDER WITHIN THE INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES

52. All the ten A/B articles in each of the Incoterms® rules are important—but some are more important than others.

53. There has, indeed, been a radical shake-up in the internal order in which the ten articles within each Incoterms® rule have been organised. In *Incoterms® 2020*, the internal order within each Incoterms® rule now follows this sequence:

A1/B1 General obligations  
A2/B2 Delivery/Taking delivery  
A3/B3 Transfer of risksA4/B4 Carriage  
A5/B5 Insurance  
A6/B6 Delivery/transport document  
A7/B7 Export/import clearance  
A8/B8 Checking/packaging/markings  
A9/B9 Allocation of costs  
A10/B10 Notices

54. It will be noticed that concerning the Incoterms® 2020 rules, after recording in A1/B1 the basic goods/payment obligations of the parties, Delivery and the Transfer of risks are moved to a more prominent location, namely to A2 and A3 respectively.

55. The broad sequence thereafter goes:

- ancillary contracts (A4/B4 and A5/B5, carriage and insurance);
- transport documents (A6/B6);
- export/import clearance (A7/B7);
- packaging (A8/B8);
- costs (A9/B9); and
- notices (A10/B10).

56. It is appreciated that this change in the order of the A/B articles will take some time—and cost—to become familiar. It is hoped that with delivery and risk now made more prominent, traders will find it easier to identify the differences among the various Incoterms® rules, i.e. the different points in time and place at which the seller “delivers” the goods to the buyer with risk transferring to the buyer from that time and point.

57. For the first time, the Incoterms® rules are published both in the traditional format setting out the eleven Incoterms® rules and in a new “horizontal” format setting out the ten articles within each Incoterms® rule under each of the headings listed above in paragraph 53, first for the seller and then for the buyer. Traders can therefore now far more easily see the difference, for example, between the place of delivery in FCA and the place of delivery in DAP; or the items of cost which fall on a buyer in CIF when compared with the items of cost which fall on a buyer in CFR. It is hoped that this “horizontal” representation of the Incoterms® 2020 rules will further assist traders in choosing the Incoterms® rule most appropriate to their commercial requirements.

#### IX. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INCOTERMS® 2010 AND 2020

58. The most important initiative behind the Incoterms® 2020 rules has been to focus on how the presentation could be enhanced to steer users towards the right Incoterms® rule for their sale contract. Thus:

1. a greater emphasis in this Introduction on making the right choice;
2. a clearer explanation of the demarcation and connection between the sale contract and its ancillary contracts;
3. upgraded Guidance Notes presented now as Explanatory Notes to each Incoterms® rule; and
4. a re-ordering within the Incoterms® rules giving delivery and risk more prominence.

All these changes, though cosmetic in appearance, are in reality substantial attempts on the part of ICC to assist the international trading community towards smoother export/import transactions.

59. Apart from these general changes, there are more substantive changes in the Incoterms® 2020 rules when compared with *Incoterms® 2010*. Before looking at those changes, mention must be made of a particular development in trade practice which occurred since 2010 and which ICC has decided should not lead to a change in the Incoterms® 2020 rules, namely Verified Gross Mass (VGM).

60. *Note on Verified Gross Mass (VGM)*—Since 1 July 2016, Regulation 2 under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) imposed on shippers in the case of the shipment of containers the obligation either to weigh the packed container using calibrated and certified equipment, or to weigh thecontents of the container and add the weight of the container when empty. In either case, the VGM is to be recorded with the carrier. A failure to comply bears the sanction under the SOLAS Convention that the container "should not be loaded onto a ship": see paragraph 4.2, MSC1/Circ.1475, 9 June 2014.

These weighing operations obviously incur expense and failure may lead to delay in loading. As this happened after 2010, it is unsurprising that there was some pressure in the consultations leading to *Incoterms® 2020* for a clear indication to be given as to who, as between seller and buyer, should bear such obligations.

61. It was felt by the Drafting Group that obligations and costs relating to VGM were too specific and complex to warrant explicit mention in the *Incoterms® 2020* rules.

62. Returning to the changes made by ICC to the *Incoterms® 2010* rules in the *Incoterms® 2020* rules, these are:

- [a] Bills of lading with an on-board notation and the FCA *Incoterms®* rule
- [b] Costs, where they are listed
- [c] Different levels of insurance cover in CIF and CIP
- [d] Arranging for carriage with seller's or buyer's own means of transport in FCA, DAP, DPU and DDP
- [e] Change in the three-letter initials for DAT to DPU
- [f] Inclusion of security-related requirements within carriage obligations and costs
- [g] Explanatory Notes for Users

#### [a] Bills of lading with an on-board notation and the FCA *Incoterms®* rule

63. Where goods are sold FCA for carriage by sea, sellers or buyers (or more likely their banks where a letter of credit is in place) might want a bill of lading with an on-board notation.

64. However, delivery under the FCA rule is completed before the loading of the goods on board the vessel. It is by no means certain that the seller can obtain an on-board bill of lading from the carrier. That carrier is likely, under its contract of carriage, to be bound and entitled to issue an on-board bill of lading only once the goods are actually on board.

65. To cater for this situation, FCA A6/B6 of *Incoterms® 2020* now provides for an additional option. The buyer and the seller can agree that the buyer will instruct its carrier to issue an on-board bill of lading to the seller after the loading of the goods, the seller then being obliged to tender that bill of lading to the buyer, typically through the banks. ICC recognises that, despite this somewhat unhappy union between an on-board bill of lading and FCA delivery, this caters for a demonstrated need in the marketplace. Finally, it should be emphasised that even where this optional mechanism is adopted, the seller is under no obligation to the buyer as to the terms of the contract of carriage.

66. Does it remain true to say that where containerised goods are delivered by seller to buyer by handing over to a carrier before loading onto a ship, the seller is well advised to sell on FCA terms rather than on FOB terms? The answer to that question is Yes. Where *Incoterms® 2020* have made a difference, however, is that where such a seller still wants or needs a bill of lading with an on-board notation, the new additional option in the FCA term A6/B6 makes provision for such a document.

#### [b] Costs, where they are listed

67. In the new ordering of the articles within the *Incoterms® 2020* rules, costs now appear at A9/B9 of each *Incoterms®* rule. Apart from that re-location, however, there is another change that will become obvious to users early on. The various costs which fall to be allocated by various articles within the *Incoterms®* rules have traditionally appeared in different parts of each *Incoterms®* rule. Thus, for example, costs related to the obtaining of a delivery document in FOB 2010 were mentioned in A8, the article under the heading "Delivery Document", but not in A6, the article under the heading "Allocation of Costs".

68. In the *Incoterms® 2020* rules, however, the equivalent of A6/B6, namely A9/B9, now lists all the costs allocated by each particular *Incoterms®* rule. A9/B9 in the *Incoterms® 2020* rules are consequently longer than A6/B6 in the *Incoterms® 2010* rules.

69. The purpose is to provide users with a one-stop list of costs, so that the seller or buyer can now find in one place all the costs for which it would be responsible under that particular *Incoterms®* rule. Items of cost arealso mentioned in their home article: thus, for example, the costs involved in obtaining documents in FOB still also appear at A6/B6 as well as at A9/B9. The thinking here was that users interested in discovering the specific allocation of documentary costs might be more inclined to go to the specific article dealing with delivery documents rather than to the general article listing all the costs.

#### [c] Different levels of insurance cover in CIF and CIP

70. In the Incoterms® 2010 rules, A3 of both CIF and CIP imposed on the seller the obligation to "obtain at its own expense cargo insurance complying at least with the minimum cover as provided by Clauses (C) of the Institute Cargo Clauses (Lloyd's Market Association/International Underwriting Association 'LMA/IUA') or any similar clauses." Institute Cargo Clauses (C) provide cover for a number of listed risks, subject to itemised exclusions; Institute Cargo Clauses (A), on the other hand, cover "all risks", again subject to itemised exclusions. During the consultations leading to the Incoterms® 2020 rules, the case was made for moving from Institute Cargo Clauses (C) to Institute Cargo Clauses (A), thus increasing the cover obtained by the seller for the benefit of the buyer. This could, of course, also involve an additional cost in premium. The contrary case, namely to stay with Institute Cargo Clauses (C), was equally strongly put, particularly by those involved in the maritime trade of commodities. After considerable discussion within and beyond the Drafting Group, the decision was made to provide for different minimum cover in the CIF Incoterms® rule and in the CIP Incoterms® rule. In the first, which is much more likely to be used in the maritime commodity trades, the status quo has been retained, with Institute Cargo Clauses (C) as the default position, although it is, of course, open to the parties to agree to higher cover. In the second, namely the CIP Incoterms® rule, the seller must now obtain insurance cover complying with Institute Cargo Clauses (A), although it is, of course, again open to the parties to agree on a lower level of cover.

#### [d] Arranging for carriage with seller's or buyer's own means of transport in FCA, DAP, DPU and DDP

71. In the Incoterms® 2010 rules, it was assumed throughout that where the goods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer, they would be carried by a third-party carrier engaged for the purpose either by the seller or the buyer, depending on which Incoterms® rule was used.

72. It became clear in the deliberations leading to Incoterms® 2020, however, that there were some situations where, although the goods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer, they could be so carried without any third-party carrier being engaged at all. Thus, for example, there was nothing stopping a seller on a D rule from arranging for such carriage without outsourcing that function to a third party, namely by using its own means of transportation. Likewise, with an FCA purchase, there was nothing to stop the buyer from using its own vehicle for the collection of the goods and for their transport to the buyer's premises.

73. The rules appeared not to take account of these eventualities. The Incoterms® 2020 rules now do, by expressly allowing not only for the making of a contract of carriage, but also for simply arranging for the necessary carriage.

#### [e] Change in the three-letter initials for DAT to DPU

74. The only difference between DAT and DAP in the Incoterms® 2010 rules was that in DAT the seller delivered the goods once unloaded from the arriving means of transport into a "terminal"; whereas in DAP, the seller delivered the goods when the goods were placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport for unloading. It will also be recalled that the Guidance Note for DAT in Incoterms® 2010 defined the word "terminal" broadly to include "any place, whether covered or not..."

75. ICC decided to make two changes to DAT and DAP. First, the order in which the two Incoterms® 2020 rules are presented has been inverted, and DAP, where delivery happens before unloading, now appears before DAT. Secondly, the name of the rule DAT has been changed to DPU (Delivered at Place Unloaded), emphasising the reality that the place of destination could be any place and not only a "terminal". However, if that place is not in a terminal, the seller should make sure that the place where it intends to deliver the goods is a place where it is able to unload the goods.

#### [f] Inclusion of security-related requirements within carriage obligations and costs

76. It will be recalled that security-related requirements made a rather subdued entry into the Incoterms® 2010 rules, through A2/B2 and A10/B10 in each rule. The Incoterms® 2010 rules were the first revision of the Incoterms® rules to come into force after security-related concerns became so prevalent in the early part of this century. Those concerns, and the associated shipping practices which they have created in their wake,are now much more established. Connected as they are to carriage requirements, an express allocation of security-related obligations has now been added to A4 and A7 of each Incoterms® rule. The costs incurred by these requirements are also now given a more prominent position in the costs article, namely A9/B9.

#### [g] Explanatory Notes for Users

77. The Guidance Notes appearing at the start of each Incoterms® rule in the 2010 version now appear as "Explanatory Notes for Users". These Notes explain the fundamentals of each Incoterms® 2020 rule, such as when it should be used, when risk transfers and how costs are allocated between seller and buyer. The Explanatory Notes are intended (a) to help the user accurately and efficiently steer towards the appropriate Incoterms® rule for a particular transaction; and (b) to provide those deciding or advising on disputes or contracts governed by *Incoterms® 2020* with guidance on matters which might require interpretation. For guidance on more fundamental issues that cut across the Incoterms® 2020 rules more generally, reference may, of course, also be made to the text of this Introduction.

#### X. CAUTION WITH VARIANTS OF INCOTERMS® RULES

78. Sometimes the parties want to alter an Incoterms® rule. The Incoterms® 2020 rules do not prohibit such alteration, but there are dangers in so doing. In order to avoid any unwelcome surprises, the parties would need to make the intended effect of such alterations extremely clear in their contract. Thus, for example, if the allocation of costs in the Incoterms® 2020 rules is altered in the contract, the parties should also clearly state whether they intend to vary the point at which delivery is made and the risk transfers to the buyer.

## EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR USERS

**1. Delivery and risk**—“Ex Works” means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer

- when it places the goods at the disposal of the buyer at a named place (like a factory or warehouse), and
- that named place may or may not be the seller's premises.

![Diagram illustrating the EXW delivery point. A blue factory building is on the left, and a yellow truck is shown near the factory, indicating the seller's premises. Arrows labeled 'COSTS' and 'RISKS' point from the factory towards the right, indicating that the seller bears all costs and risks up to the named place of delivery.](4be332dbedee9986804d42ce346253b8_7_img.webp)

For delivery to occur, the seller does not need to load the goods on any collecting vehicle, nor does it need to clear the goods for export, where such clearance is applicable.

**2. Mode of transport**—This rule may be used irrespective of the mode or modes of transport, if any, selected.

![Diagram illustrating the EXW mode of transport. A blue factory building is on the left, and a yellow warehouse is on the right. A horizontal line separates them. A truck is shown near the factory. A box containing four icons representing different modes of transport (train, airplane, truck, ship) is placed between the factory and the warehouse, indicating that the seller is not responsible for choosing or paying for the mode of transport.](4be332dbedee9986804d42ce346253b8_10_img.webp)**3. Place or precise point of delivery**—The parties need only name the *place* of delivery. However, the parties are well advised *also* to specify as clearly as possible the precise *point* within the named place of delivery. A named precise *point* of delivery makes it clear to both parties when the goods are delivered and when risk transfers to the buyer; such precision also marks the point at which costs are for the buyer's account. If the parties do *not* name the *point* of delivery, then they are taken to have left it to the seller to select the point "that best suits its purpose". This means that the buyer may incur the risk that the seller may choose a point just before the point at which goods are lost or damaged. Best for the buyer therefore to select the precise point within a place where delivery will occur.

**4. A note of caution to buyers**—EXW is the Incoterms® rule which imposes the least set of obligations on the seller. From the buyer's perspective, therefore, the rule should be used with care for different reasons as set out below.

**5. Loading risks**— Delivery happens—and risk transfers—when the goods are placed, not loaded, at the buyer's disposal. However, risk of loss of or damage to the goods occurring while the loading operation is carried out by the seller, as it may well be, might arguably lie with the buyer, who has not physically participated in the loading. Given this possibility, it would be advisable, where the seller is to load the goods, for the parties to agree in advance who is to bear the risk of any loss of or damage to the goods during loading. This is a common situation simply because the seller is more likely to have the necessary loading equipment at its own premises or because applicable safety or security rules prevent access to the seller's premises by unauthorised personnel. Where the buyer is keen to avoid any risk during loading at the seller's premises, then the buyer ought to consider choosing the FCA rule (under which, if the goods are delivered at the seller's premises, the seller owes the buyer an obligation to load, with the risk of loss of or damage to the goods during that operation remaining with the seller).

**6. Export clearance**—With delivery happening when the goods are at the buyer's disposal either at the seller's premises or at another named point typically within the seller's jurisdiction or within the same Customs Union, there is no obligation on the seller to organise export clearance or clearance within third countries through which the goods pass in transit. Indeed, EXW may be suitable for domestic trades, where there is no intention at all to export the goods. The seller's participation in exportclearance is limited to providing assistance in obtaining such documents and information as the buyer may require for the purpose of exporting the goods. Where the buyer intends to export the goods and where it anticipates difficulty in obtaining export clearance, the buyer would be better advised to choose the FCA rule, under which the obligation and cost of obtaining export clearance lies with the seller.

## EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR USERS

1. **Delivery and risk**—“Free Carrier (named place)” means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer in one or other of two ways.

- First, when the named place is the seller's premises, the goods are delivered
  - when they are loaded on the means of transport arranged by the buyer.

![Diagram illustrating the first scenario of FCA delivery: Goods are loaded onto a truck at the seller's premises (blue building). The seller's costs and risks are shown up to the point of loading. The buyer's costs and risks are shown from the point of loading onwards.](a21e2cb9fc1331d76f0222b91752e466_7_img.webp)

- Second, when the named place is another place, the goods are delivered
  - when, having been loaded on the seller's means of transport,
  - they reach the named other place and- are ready for unloading from that seller's means of transport and
- at the disposal of the carrier or of another person nominated by the buyer.

![Diagram illustrating the transfer of costs and risks between seller and buyer. A truck is shown moving goods from a blue building (seller's premises) to a yellow building (buyer's premises). Arrows indicate that costs and risks transfer at the point of delivery, which is the point where the truck is ready for unloading.](8efe020aad57e61e3b3b185a8707cc3d_2_img.webp)

Whichever of the two is chosen as the place of delivery, that place identifies where risk transfers to the buyer and the time from which costs are for the buyer's account.

**2. Mode of transport**—This rule may be used irrespective of the mode of transport selected and may also be used where more than one mode of transport is employed.

![Diagram illustrating various modes of transport (truck, airplane, truck, ship) used in international trade, connecting a blue building (seller's premises) and a yellow building (buyer's premises).](8efe020aad57e61e3b3b185a8707cc3d_5_img.webp)

**3. Place or point of delivery**—A sale under FCA can be concluded naming only the place of delivery, either at the seller's premises or elsewhere, without specifying the precise point of delivery within that named place. However, the parties are well advised *also* to specify as clearly as possible the precise *point* within the named place of delivery. A named precise *point* of delivery makes it clear to both parties when the goods are delivered and when risk transfers to the buyer; such precision also marks the point at which costs are for the buyer's account. Where the precise point is not identified, however, this may cause problems for the buyer. The seller in this case has the right to select the point "that best suits its purpose": that point becomes the point of delivery, from which risk and costs transfer to the buyer. If the precise point of delivery is not identified by naming it in the contract, then the parties are taken to have left it to the seller to select the point "that best suits its purpose". This means thatthe buyer may incur the risk that the seller may choose a point just before the point at which goods are lost or damaged. Best for the buyer therefore to select the precise point within a place where delivery will occur.

4. **'or procure goods so delivered'**—The reference to “procure” here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly, although not exclusively, common in the commodity trades.

5. **Export/import clearance**—FCA requires the seller to clear the goods for export, where applicable. However, the seller has no obligation to clear the goods for import or for transit through third countries, to pay any import duty or to carry out any import customs formalities.

![Diagram illustrating FCA (Free Carrier) terms. A blue house (Seller) is on the left, and a yellow house (Buyer) is on the right, separated by a horizontal line. A label below the blue house reads 'Seller's export formalities'. A label below the yellow house reads 'Buyer's import formalities'.](ce0fec754e77551a3f11565822a4c811_3_img.webp)

6. **Bills of lading with an on-board notation in FCA sales**—We have already seen that FCA is intended for use irrespective of the mode or modes of transport used. Now if goods are being picked up by the buyer's road-haulier in Las Vegas, it would be rather uncommon to expect a bill of lading with an on-board notation to be issued by the carrier *from Las Vegas*, which is not a port and which a vessel cannot reach for goods to be placed on board. Nonetheless, sellers selling FCA Las Vegas do sometimes find themselves in a situation where they *need* a bill of lading with an on-board notation (typically because of a bank collection or a letter of credit requirement), albeit necessarily stating that the goods have been placed on board in Los Angeles as well as stating that they were received for carriage in Las Vegas. To cater for this possibility of an FCA seller needing a bill of lading with an on-board notation, FCA Incoterms® 2020 has, for the first time, provided the following optional mechanism. If the parties have so agreed in the contract, the buyer must instruct its carrier to issue a bill of lading with an on-board notation to the seller. The carrier may or may not, of course, accede to the buyer's request, given that the carrier is only bound and entitled to issue such a bill of lading once the goods are on board in Los Angeles. However, if and when the bill of lading is issued to the seller by the carrier at the buyer's cost and risk, the seller must provide that same document to the buyer, who will need the bill of lading in order to obtain discharge of the goods from the carrier. This optionalmechanism becomes unnecessary, of course, if the parties have agreed that the seller will present to the buyer a bill of lading stating simply that the goods have been received for shipment rather than that they have been shipped on board. Moreover, it should be emphasised that even where this optional mechanism is adopted, the seller is under no obligation to the buyer as to the terms of the contract of carriage. Finally, when this optional mechanism is adopted, the dates of delivery inland and loading on board will necessarily be different, which may well create difficulties for the seller under a letter of credit.

CPT (insert named place of destination) Incoterms® 2020

![Diagram illustrating the CPT Incoterm. A truck moves from a blue building (seller's location) to a yellow building (buyer's location). Two horizontal lines represent costs (blue) and risks (yellow). The costs line extends fully to the buyer's location, while the risks line ends at the seller's location. Labels indicate 'Export formalities' near the seller and 'Import formalities' near the buyer.](e88a88d0372f47d8a52442ad59e0cab1_3_img.webp)

## EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR USERS

1. **Delivery and risk**—"Carriage Paid To" means that the seller delivers the goods—and transfers the risk—to the buyer
   - by handing them over to the carrier
   - contracted by the seller
   - or by procuring the goods so delivered.
   - The seller may do so by giving the carrier physical possession of the goods in the manner and at the place appropriate to the means of transport used.

![Diagram illustrating the delivery point for CPT. A truck is shown at the seller's location (blue building) with a downward arrow labeled 'DELIVERY'. The costs line extends fully to the buyer's location (yellow building), while the risks line ends at the seller's location.](e88a88d0372f47d8a52442ad59e0cab1_6_img.webp)

Once the goods have been delivered to the buyer in this way, the seller does not guarantee that the goods will reach the place of destination in sound condition, in the stated quantity or indeed at all. This is because risk transfers from seller to buyer when the goods are delivered to the buyer by handing them over to the carrier; the seller must nonetheless contract for the carriage of the goods from delivery to the agreed destination. Thus, for example, goods are handed over to a carrier in Las Vegas (which is not a port) for carriage to Southampton (a port) or to Winchester (which is not a port). In either case, delivery transferring risk to the buyer happens in Las Vegas, and the seller must make a contract of carriage to either Southampton or Winchester.2. **Mode of transport**—This rule may be used irrespective of the mode of transport selected and may also be used where more than one mode of transport is employed.

![Illustration showing four modes of transport: truck, airplane, truck, and ship, enclosed in a box, with buildings on either side.](31ee88e3863efc0c416fbe1ddf153d88_2_img.webp)

3. **Places (or points) of delivery and destination**—In CPT, two locations are important: the place or point (if any) at which the goods are delivered (for the transfer of risk) and the place or point agreed as the destination of the goods (as the point to which the seller promises to contract for carriage).

4. **Identifying the place or point of delivery with precision**—The parties are well advised to identify both places, or indeed points within those places, as precisely as possible in the contract of sale. Identifying the place or point (if any) of delivery as precisely as possible is important to cater for the common situation where several carriers are engaged, each for different legs of the transit from delivery to destination. Where this happens and the parties do not agree on a specific place or point of delivery, the default position is that risk transfers when the goods have been delivered to the first carrier at a point entirely of the seller's choosing and over which the buyer has no control. Should the parties wish the risk to transfer at a later stage (e.g. at a sea or river port or at an airport), or indeed an earlier one (e.g. an inland point some way away from a sea or river port), they need to specify this in their contract of sale and to carefully think through the consequences of so doing in case the goods are lost or damaged.

5. **Identifying the destination as precisely as possible**—The parties are also well advised to identify as precisely as possible in the contract of sale the point within the agreed place of destination, as this is the point to which the seller must contract for carriage and this is the point to which the costs of carriage fall on the seller.

6. **'or procuring the goods so delivered'**—The reference to "procure" here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly common in the commodity trades.7. **Costs of unloading at destination**—If the seller incurs costs under its contract of carriage related to unloading at the named place of destination, the seller is not entitled to recover such costs separately from the buyer unless otherwise agreed between the parties.

8. **Export/import clearance**—CPT requires the seller to clear the goods for export, where applicable. However, the seller has no obligation to clear the goods for import or for transit through third countries, or to pay any import duty or to carry out any import customs formalities.

This may cause difficulty where the destination country requires insurance cover to be purchased locally: in this case the parties should consider selling and buying under CPT. The buyer should also note that under the CIP Incoterms® 2020 rule the seller is required to obtain extensive insurance cover complying with Institute Cargo Clauses (A) or similar clause, rather than with the more limited cover under Institute Cargo Clauses (C).

## EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR USERS

1. **Delivery and risk**—"Delivered at Place" means that the seller delivers the goods—and transfers risk—to the buyer
   - when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer
   - on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading
   - at the named place of destination or
   - at the agreed point within that place, if any such point is agreed.

The seller bears all risks involved in bringing the goods to the named place of destination or to the agreed point within that place. In this Incoterms® rule, therefore, delivery and arrival at destination are the same.

1. **Mode of transport**—This rule may be used irrespective of the mode of transport selected and may also be used where more than one mode of transport is employed.![Illustration showing four modes of transport (train, airplane, truck, and ship) enclosed in a box, flanked by two buildings, symbolizing international trade and delivery points.](53a67d517f5574e585a9b25a8403c7f0_1_img.webp)

**3. Identifying the place or point of delivery/destination precisely**—The parties are well advised to specify the destination place or point as clearly as possible and this for several reasons. First, risk of loss of or damage to the goods transfers to the buyer at that point of delivery/destination—and it is best for the seller and the buyer to be clear about the point at which that critical transfer happens. Secondly, the costs before that place or point of delivery/destination are for the account of the seller and the costs after that place or point are for the account of the buyer. Thirdly, the seller must contract or arrange for the carriage of the goods to the agreed place or point of delivery/destination. If it fails to do so, the seller is in breach of its obligations under the Incoterms® DAP rule and will be liable to the buyer for any ensuing loss. Thus, for example, the seller would be responsible for any additional costs levied by the carrier to the buyer for any additional on-carriage.

**4. 'or procuring the goods so delivered'**—The reference to “procure” here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly common in the commodity trades.

**5. Unloading costs**—The seller is not required to unload the goods from the arriving means of transportation. However, if the seller incurs costs under its contract of carriage related to unloading at the place of delivery/destination, the seller is not entitled to recover such costs separately from the buyer unless otherwise agreed between the parties.

**6. Export/import clearance**—DAP requires the seller to clear the goods for export, where applicable. However, the seller has no obligation to clear the goods for import or for post-delivery transit through third countries, to pay any import duty or to carry out any import customs formalities. As a result, if the buyer fails to organise import clearance, the goods will be held up at a port or inland terminal in the destination country. Who bears the risk of any loss that might occur while the goods are thus held up at the port of entry in the destination country? The answer is the buyer: delivery will not have occurred yet, B3(a) ensuring that the risk of loss of or damage to the goods is with the buyer until transit to a named inland point can beresumed. If, in order to avoid this scenario, the parties intend the seller to clear the goods for import, pay any import duty or tax and carry out any import customs formalities, the parties might consider using DDP.

- cleared for import,

- ready for unloading,
- at the named place of destination or at the agreed point within that place, if any such point is agreed.

The seller bears all risks involved in bringing the goods to the named place of destination or to the agreed point within that place. In this Incoterms® rule, therefore, delivery and arrival at destination are the same.

2. **Mode of transport**—This rule may be used irrespective of the mode of transport selected and may also be used where more than one mode of transport is employed.

3. **A note of caution to sellers: maximum responsibility**—DDP, with delivery happening at destination and with the seller being responsible for the payment of import duty and applicable taxes is the Incoterms® rule imposing on the seller the maximum level of obligation of all eleven Incoterms® rules. From the seller's perspective, therefore, the rule should be used with care for different reasons as set out in paragraph 7.

4. **Identifying the place or point of delivery/destination precisely**—The parties are well advised to specify the destination place or point as clearly as possible and this for several reasons. First, risk of loss of or damage to the goods transfers to the buyer at that point of delivery/destination—and it is best for the seller and the buyer to be clear about the point at which that critical transfer happens. Secondly, the costs before that place or point of delivery/destination are for the account of the seller, including the costs of import clearance, and the costs after that place or point, other than the costs of import, are for the account of the buyer. Thirdly, the seller must contract or arrange for the carriage of the goods to the agreed place or point of delivery/destination. If it fails to do so, the seller is in breach of its obligations under the Incoterms® rule DDP and will be liable to the buyer for any ensuing loss. Thus, for example, the seller would be responsible for any additional costs levied by the carrier to the buyer for any additional on-carriage.5. **'or procuring the goods so delivered'**—The reference to “procure” here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly common in the commodity trades.

6. **Unloading costs**—If the seller incurs costs under its contract of carriage related to unloading at the place of delivery/destination, the seller is not entitled to recover such costs separately from the buyer unless otherwise agreed between the parties.

7. **Export/import clearance**—As set out in paragraph 3, DDP requires the seller to clear the goods for export, where applicable, as well as for import and to pay any import duty or to carry out any customs formalities. Thus if the seller is unable to obtain import clearance and would rather leave that side of things in the buyer's hands in the country of import, then the seller should consider choosing DAP or DPU, under which rules delivery still happens at destination, but with import clearance being left to the buyer. There may be tax implications and this tax may not be recoverable from the buyer: see A9(d).

## EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR USERS

1. **Delivery and risk**—"Free Alongside Ship" means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer

- when the goods are placed alongside the ship (e.g. on a quay or a barge)
- nominated by the buyer
- at the named port of shipment
- or when the seller procures goods already so delivered.

The risk of loss of or damage to the goods transfers when the goods are alongside the ship, and the buyer bears all costs from that moment onwards.

![Diagram illustrating FAS delivery where goods are placed on a quay alongside the ship. The diagram shows a blue factory, a ship docked, and goods being delivered (labeled 'DELIVERY'). Arrows indicate that COSTS (blue arrow) and RISKS (orange arrow) transfer at the point of delivery.](f7d92c70ba4e83d38d22d113b0c854ec_8_img.webp)![Diagram illustrating FAS delivery where goods are placed on a barge alongside the ship. The diagram shows a blue factory, a ship, and a barge carrying goods (labeled 'DELIVERY'). Arrows indicate that COSTS (blue arrow) and RISKS (orange arrow) transfer at the point of delivery.](f7d92c70ba4e83d38d22d113b0c854ec_9_img.webp)**2. Mode of transport**—This rule is to be used only for sea or inland waterway transport where the parties intend to deliver the goods by placing the goods alongside a vessel. Thus, the FAS rule is not appropriate where goods are handed over to the carrier before they are alongside the vessel, for example where goods are handed over to a carrier at a container terminal. Where this is the case, parties should consider using the FCA rule rather than the FAS rule.

![Diagram illustrating the FAS (Free Alongside Ship) rule. A blue building (seller's location) is connected by a line to a ship icon floating on water. A yellow building (buyer's location) is connected by a line to the ship icon. This shows the transfer of goods occurs alongside the ship.](f46f7657c3c2536dd07fe8825e4c9739_2_img.webp)

**3. Identifying the loading point precisely**—The parties are well advised to specify as clearly as possible the loading point at the named port of shipment where the goods are to be transferred from the quay or barge to the ship, as the costs and risks to that point are for the account of the seller and these costs and associated handling charges may vary according to the practice of the port.

**4. 'or procuring the goods so delivered'**—The seller is required either to deliver the goods alongside the ship or to procure goods already so delivered for shipment. The reference to "procure" here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly common in the commodity trades.

**5. Export/import clearance**—FAS requires the seller to clear the goods for export, where applicable. However, the seller has no obligation to clear the goods for import or for transit through third countries, to pay any import duty or to carry out any import customs formalities.

![Diagram illustrating export and import formalities. A blue building (seller's location) is connected by a line to a ship icon floating on water.

   - or procures the goods already so delivered.

The risk of loss of or damage to the goods transfers when the goods are on board the vessel, such that the seller is taken to have performed its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods actually arrive at their destination in sound condition, in the stated quantity or, indeed, at all. In CFR, the seller owes no obligation to the buyer to purchase insurance cover: the buyer would be well-advised therefore to purchase some cover for itself.

1. **Mode of transport**—This rule is to be used only for sea or inland waterway transport. Where more than one mode of transport is to be used, which will commonly be the case where goods are handed over to a carrier at a container terminal, the appropriate rule to use is CPT rather than CFR.![Illustration showing a blue factory building connected by a line to a ship icon, which is connected by a line to a yellow house icon, symbolizing the flow of goods from production to consumption.](3f941b2c0fe809c59608cec983719ba1_1_img.webp)

3. **'or procuring the goods so delivered'**—The reference to “procure” here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly common in the commodity trades.

4. **Ports of delivery and destination**—In CFR, two ports are important: the port where the goods are delivered on board the vessel and the port agreed as the destination of the goods. Risk transfers from seller to buyer when the goods are delivered to the buyer by placing them on board the vessel at the shipment port or by procuring the goods already so delivered. However, the seller must contract for the carriage of the goods from delivery to the agreed destination. Thus, for example, goods are placed on board a vessel in Shanghai (which is a port) for carriage to Southampton (also a port). Delivery here happens when the goods are on board in Shanghai, with risk transferring to the buyer at that time; and the seller must make a contract of carriage from Shanghai to Southampton.

5. **Must the shipment port be named?**—While the contract will always specify a destination port, it might not specify the port of shipment, which is where risk transfers to the buyer. If the shipment port is of particular interest to the buyer, as it may be, for example, where the buyer wishes to ascertain that the freight element of the price is reasonable, the parties are well advised to identify it as precisely as possible in the contract.

6. **Identifying the destination point at the discharge port**—The parties are well advised to identify as precisely as possible the point at the named port of destination, as the costs to that point are for the account of the seller. The seller must make a contract or contracts of carriage that cover(s) the transit of the goods from delivery to the named port or to the agreed point within that port where such a point has been agreed in the contract of sale.

7. **Multiple carriers**—It is possible that carriage is effected through several carriers for different legs of the sea transport, for example, first by a carrier operating a feeder vessel from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and then onto an ocean vessel from Shanghai to Southampton. The question which ariseshere is whether risk transfers from seller to buyer at Hong Kong or at Shanghai: where does delivery take place? The parties may well have agreed this in the sale contract itself. Where, however, there is no such agreement, the default position is that risk transfers when the goods have been delivered to the first carrier, i.e. Hong Kong, thus increasing the period during which the buyer incurs the risk of loss or damage. Should the parties wish the risk to transfer at a later stage (here, Shanghai) they need to specify this in their contract of sale.

## EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR USERS

1. **Delivery and risk**—"Cost Insurance and Freight" means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer

- on board the vessel
- or procures the goods already so delivered.

![Diagram illustrating the delivery point for CIF. The diagram shows a blue factory, a ship, and a yellow warehouse connected by a wavy line representing transport. The delivery point is marked by an arrow labeled 'DELIVERY' pointing to the ship. The costs and risks are divided by a vertical line at the ship. The left side (blue) shows 'COSTS RISKS' and 'Export formalities'. The right side (yellow) shows 'COSTS RISKS' and 'Import formalities'. This diagram visually represents that the seller's obligation to deliver is fulfilled when the goods are on board the vessel.](2a0c90d80d0baa96b61746124fa93db6_7_img.webp)

The risk of loss of or damage to the goods transfers when the goods are on board the vessel, such that the seller is taken to have performed its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods actually arrive at their destination in sound condition, in the stated quantity or, indeed, at all.

2. **Mode of transport**—This rule is to be used only for sea or inland waterway transport. Where more than one mode of transport is to be used, which will commonly be the case where goods are handed over to a carrier at a container terminal, the appropriate rule to use is CIP rather than CIF.![Illustration showing a blue building connected by a line to a ship icon, which is connected by a line to a yellow building, symbolizing a chain of delivery or sales.](895f1696059bd824e4478736c98f571b_1_img.webp)

3. **'or procuring the goods so delivered'**—The reference to “procure” here caters for multiple sales down a chain (string sales), particularly common in the commodity trades.

4. **Ports of delivery and destination**—In CIF, two ports are important: the port where the goods are delivered on board the vessel and the port agreed as the destination of the goods. Risk transfers from seller to buyer when the goods are delivered to the buyer by placing them on board the vessel at the shipment port or by procuring the goods already so delivered. However, the seller must contract for the carriage of the goods from delivery to the agreed destination. Thus, for example, goods are placed on board a vessel in Shanghai (which is a port) for carriage to Southampton (also a port). Delivery here happens when the goods are on board in Shanghai, with risk transferring to the buyer at that time; and the seller must make a contract of carriage from Shanghai to Southampton.

5. **Must the shipment port be named?**—While the contract will always specify a destination port, it might not specify the port of shipment, which is where risk transfers to the buyer. If the shipment port is of particular interest to the buyer, as it may be, for example, where the buyer wishes to ascertain that the freight or the insurance element of the price is reasonable, the parties are well advised to identify it as precisely as possible in the contract.

6. **Identifying the destination point at the discharge port**—The parties are well advised to identify as precisely as possible the point at the named port of destination, as the costs to that point are for the account of the seller. The seller must make a contract or contracts of carriage that cover the transit of the goods from delivery to the named port or to the agreed point within that port where such a point has been agreed in the contract of sale.

7. **Multiple carriers**—It is possible that carriage is effected through several carriers for different legs of the sea transport, for example, first by a carrier operating a feeder vessel from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and then onto anocean vessel from Shanghai to Southampton. The question which arises here is whether risk transfers from seller to buyer at Hong Kong or at Shanghai: where does delivery take place? The parties may well have agreed this in the sale contract itself. Where, however, there is no such agreement, the default position is that risk transfers when the goods have been delivered to the first carrier, i.e. Hong Kong, thus increasing the period during which the buyer incurs the risk of loss or damage. Should the parties wish the risk to transfer at a later stage (here, Shanghai) they need to specify this in their contract of sale.

**8. Insurance**—The seller must also contract for insurance cover against the buyer's risk of loss of or damage to the goods from the port of shipment to at least the port of destination. This may cause difficulty where the destination country requires insurance cover to be purchased locally: in this case the parties should consider selling and buying under CFR. The buyer should also note that under the CIF Incoterms® 2020 rule the seller is required to obtain limited insurance cover complying with Institute Cargo Clauses (C) or similar clause, rather than with the more extensive cover under Institute Cargo Clauses (A). It is, however, still open to the parties to agree on a higher level of cover.

![Diagram illustrating the transfer of risk and insurance coverage during international shipping. A blue arrow labeled 'RISKS' and a yellow arrow labeled 'INSURANCE' show the coverage extending from the seller's location (blue house) to the buyer's location (yellow house), passing through the port of shipment and the port of destination, where the goods are loaded onto and unloaded from the vessel.](b0afa5e0c6493317882e3f81cff665cc_3_img.webp)

**9. Unloading costs**—If the seller incurs costs under its contract of carriage related to unloading at the specified point at the port of destination, the seller is not entitled to recover such costs separately from the buyer unless otherwise agreed between the parties.

**10. Export/import clearance**—CIF requires the seller to clear the goods for export, where applicable. However, the seller has no obligation to clear the goods for import or for transit through third countries, to pay any import duty or to carry out any import customs formalities.![Diagram illustrating the transfer of obligations between the seller and buyer.
